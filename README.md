## Outline
* [Guessing Number Game](https://github.com/trinhgiahuy/Programming1_Course-Python-/blob/master/src/(GUI)Guessing_Number_Game.py)

  The topic of this project is not fixed, but rather, everyone can implement a graphical userinterface in the style they want, on the basis of their own abilities and interests. The task description will, however, give an idea on how complicated the implemented userinterface should be to achieve different grades.

  Additionally, we have set the following minimum requirements to the program:

  * A calculator is not a valid topic for a project.
  * A program that has already been implemented as an example during course materials would not be a valid topic for a project i.e. lecture example in Tkinter, programming task in the Tkinter round, nor a program edited from the aforementioned programs by developing them a little further. If you wish, you can, however, implement a graphical userinterface to one of the programs you implemented during the course which did not originally contain a graphical userinterface.
  * The program must include interaction with the user and it must be possible for the user to give incorrect entries. The program has to react to them fluently. In error situations, the user must receive a clear error notification. The execution of the program is thus not meant to end, but after the error, the user must have an opportunity to continue giving new entries.
  * The program must process the errors in a way that the Pycharm console does not display Python errormessages.
